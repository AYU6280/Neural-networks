This model has been trained on the diabetes dataset from sklearn framework. 
The main focus has been put on creating the neural network and experimenting with the result of the using multiple layers and increasing or decreasing the nodes. 
Also, by changing the optimizer.

Model specs:
1) 100 epochs
2) activation function = ReLu
3) dropout = 0.3 
4) target variable = age
5) last epoch loss = 0.0178
